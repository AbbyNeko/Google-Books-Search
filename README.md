# Google Books Search

### Overview

The app is a React-based Google Books Search app. It utitlizes Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

### Instructions

* This application has 2 pages:

  * Search - User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

  * Saved - Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.


### Update Below in Progress

* Use React routing and [socket.io](http://socket.io) to create a notification or a component that triggers whenever a user saves an book. Your message should include the title of the saved book.

  * Say you have multiple browsers open, each one visiting your site. If you save an book in one browser, then all of your browsers should notify you that a new book was saved.

  * [Socket.io NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io)
